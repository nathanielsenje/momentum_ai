# Momentum AI

Momentum AI is a smart productivity application designed to help you align your daily tasks with your energy levels. By leveraging AI, the app provides intelligent task suggestions, tracks your progress, and helps you build momentum to achieve your goals more effectively. The core idea is to work smarter, not just harder, by tackling tasks that are best suited for your current state of mind and body.

## UI/UX Layout

The application is designed with a clean, modern, and futuristic aesthetic, featuring a dark theme with vibrant accents to keep the interface engaging and easy on the eyes. The layout is organized into a simple and intuitive structure.

### Main Layout

The main layout consists of a collapsible sidebar for navigation and a main content area where the different sections of the app are displayed.

- **Sidebar Navigation**: Provides quick access to the main sections of the app:
  - **Dashboard**: The central hub of the application.
  - **Projects**: For managing different work or personal projects.
  - **Analytics**: To visualize your progress and alignment over time.

### Core Sections

1.  **Dashboard**: This is the primary screen you see upon entering the app. It's composed of several widgets designed to give you a complete overview of your day.
    - **Momentum Card**: Displays your "Daily Momentum" score, which is calculated by an AI based on how well your completed tasks align with your reported energy level. It also tracks your daily streak to keep you motivated.
    - **Energy Input**: A simple interface for you to report your current energy level for the day (Low, Medium, or High). This is the key input for the AI to generate relevant suggestions.
    - **Pomodoro Timer**: A built-in timer to help you use the Pomodoro Technique for focused work sessions.
    - **Suggested Tasks**: An AI-powered card that recommends tasks from your list that are best suited for your current energy level.
    - **Task List**: The main area for managing your to-dos. You can add new tasks, assign them a category and energy level, link them to a project, and mark them as complete.

2.  **Projects Page**: This section allows for better organization of your tasks.
    - You can create new projects to group related tasks together (e.g., "Q3 Marketing Campaign," "Personal Health Goals").
    - Each project card displays the number of pending tasks, giving you a quick overview of what's outstanding.

3.  **Analytics Page**: This page helps you understand your productivity patterns over time.
    - **Flow Visualizer**: The AI generates a visual chart and a summary report that shows your task-energy alignment, helping you identify patterns and gain insights into your workflow.
