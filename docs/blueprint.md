# **App Name**: Momentum AI

## Core Features:

- Energy-Based Task Suggestion: Suggests tasks based on the user's self-reported energy level using the AI agent, categorizing and prioritizing tasks suitable for low, medium, or high energy states.
- Daily Momentum Score: Calculates and displays a daily score reflecting the user's task-energy alignment, including streak bonuses and momentum points, using AI to summarize daily performance and provide personalized feedback.
- Task Management: Allows users to create, categorize, and complete tasks with energy-level associations. Enables task filtering based on energy type and priority.
- Energy Level Input: Presents a simple interface for users to rate their current energy level (Low, Medium, High) upon opening the app, triggering the task suggestion system.
- Momentum Streak Tracking: Tracks consecutive days of completing tasks that match the user’s reported energy level. Generates summaries for each task that summarize whether the given task matches their energy level
- Local Data Storage: Uses JSON files stored locally to persist user data, including tasks, energy ratings, momentum scores, and settings, such as task categories.
- Flow Alignment Visualizer: Visualizes the user’s task-energy alignment over time with graphs and charts that highlight their flow alignment score. An AI tool generates these reports.

- Primary color: Keppel (#2BBAA5) to evoke a sense of calm and productivity.
- Secondary color: Celadon (#93D3AE) as a supporting color for backgrounds and less important UI elements.
