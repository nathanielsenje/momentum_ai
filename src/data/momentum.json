    "summary": "Your daily momentum score is 50. You effectively aligned one of your tasks with your low energy level today, which is a great start! However, one high-energy task was completed during a low-energy period, which might have felt more draining than necessary. For future days, try to schedule your high-energy tasks during times when you anticipate feeling more energetic, or consider breaking them down into smaller, less demanding steps when your energy is low. Keep up the good work in recognizing your energy!",
